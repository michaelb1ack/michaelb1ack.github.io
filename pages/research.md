#### The value of long and short term changes in water quality  
(with Richard T. Woodward)  
We use a large pooled cross-section of angler surveys administered in Texas from 2001 - 2015 and a panel of water quality data to measure the effect of short-term and long-term changes in water quality on anticipated angler utility. Using a two-stage estimation process, we find evidence that anglers are willing to pay substantially more for long-term changes in water quality than for short-term changes.

#### An empirical estimate of the value of manageable soil quality  
(with Richard T. Woodward, Cristine Morgan, Dianna Bagnall, Erin Kiella, Marissa Cisneros, and William Alex McIntosh)  
We construct a pivoted discrete choice experiment (DCE) for farmers in a central Texas watershed to elicit the value of manageable soil quality characteristics. The initial field tests using online and paper versions of our survey provide preliminary evidence that farmers place value on improved soil quality characteristics, with water infiltration being the most valued attribute.

#### Does Self-Monitoring Lead to Better Resource Management? Evidence from Participatory Groundwater Management Program in India  
(with Nishita Sinha)  
We use a lagged-dependent fixed-effect model to estimate the causal effect of participatory groundwater management program on depth to water-table. We find that while the program led to a decrease in depth to groundwater in some areas, in absence of any incentives, the effectiveness of the intervention depends critically on the program implementing agency and strength of local groundwater institutions.
